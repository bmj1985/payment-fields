# Integrate Braintree/Stripe/Square payment fields

A React component to make integrating [Braintree's Hosted Fields](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/hosted-fields/), [Stripe's ELements](https://stripe.com/docs/elements) and [Square's Payment Form](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/articles/adding-payment-form) easier.

Care is taken so the API is (nearly) identical across the vendors.

This is intended for a Saas that allows customers to use their own payment processor, as long as it's uses the newish "hosted iframe" approach.
